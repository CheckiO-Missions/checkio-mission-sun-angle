<!-- Describe task in general -->

<p>
    Every true traveler must know how to do 3 things: fix the fire, find the water and extract useful information from the nature around him. Programming doesn't help you with the fire and water, but with the extraction of information will cope completely.
</p>

<p>
    Your task is to find out the sun angle above the horizon when you know the time of the day. Input data: the sun rises in the East at 6:00, what corresponds to angle of 0 degrees. At 12:00 the sun is in the zenith, what means that the angle = 90 degrees. 18:00 is the sunset time so the angle = 180 degrees. If the input will be the time of the night (before 6:00 or after 18:00), your function should return - "I don't see the sun!".
</p>

<!-- Explain input and output values -->
<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> The time of the day.
